This code uses concepts of Structures,Switch statement and for loop with library functions-stdio.h,stlib.h
and string.h.
We have defined username and password as "Airlinr" and "Airline@fun".
Firstly in void header the conditions and all the options are defined for the specific dates.
Then we use structures and define the variables in it ,then we scan the dates for which a person wants
to tavel for. We have an option to select the No.of tickets needed and for which flight.
Similarly, it goes for return trip too.
It gives us the summarry about your booking and the program ends.
If the username and password is wrong it gives us the result as Invalid.
